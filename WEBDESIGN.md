# What is Web-Design?
Web-design, in my opinion, is all about adding information to the already growing Internet. This is done by creating new websites about anything you want like, for example, cooking, math, origami, history, and much, much more. It honestly doesn't matter, as long as people are interested, and entertained by the information you post.
